Hangman
=======

Aliea and Anmol's finale project:
This program will use wx python to make a digital hangman game simulation
You will be given a random word to guess, your score will be kept on terminal and how many tries you have  left will be kept on a digital hangman picture
To play:
first start the game,
a certain number of bars (for example _) will apear,
a new window will be created were you can type in a letter,
from there on it is just like hangman (keep typing letters till you guess the word),
you keep on guessing until you get it right,
there shall be a picture of a hangman to tell you how many tries you have left,
you have until the whole man is completed ("hung") that you can guess
